You are given a Markdown file that may contain multiple languages. Your task is to enrich this file by identifying metadata and languages.
    
# YAML Front Matter
At the very top of your output, emit "---" followed by some metadata, and end that section with "---".
Include information on the languages of the document here. Example:

---
languages:
  fr: "française"
  en: "English"
l1: "fr"
l2: "en"
---

# Content

Next, repeat all of the markdown in the input file, but annotated.


Preserve all incoming comments. The input markdown will already have `<!-- page -->` comments.

Example:

<!-- page index=1 --->

... stuff on the cover...

<!-- page index=2 --->

... stuff from the title page ...


## Image blocks
- Preserve all markdown image references without changes

## Text blocks
Annotate all blocks of text with a language comment. E.g. `<!-- text lang="en" --> This is my house. <!-- text lang="fr" --> C'est ma maison.`
- Use ISO 639-1 or 639-3 language codes (e.g., `es` for Spanish, `mxa` for Mixteco de Santa María Zacatepec, uz-CYRL for Uzbeck in cyrillic script).
- Preserve Markdown formatting
- Books have front matter for the first 1 to 4 pages, and back matter for the last 1 or 2 pages. For each of these pages, look at every text block and determine a good label for the metadata. Then add `field="the data"` attribute to the text block. 
Examples:
<!-- text lang="fr" field="title" -->
Ma maison
<!-- text lang="en" field="title" -->
My House
<!-- text lang="fr" field="smallCoverCredits" -->
Author: John, Illustrator Suzanne
<!-- text lang="fr" field="country" -->
United States
<!-- text lang="en" field="copyright" -->
Copyright 1993, Instituto Lingüístico de Verano, A.C.
`<!-- text lang="*" field="ISBN" -->
968-31-0276`


The following are fields that you should look for and tag:
bookTitle
isbn
license (e.g. "CC-BY")
licenseUrl (e.g. "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/")
licenseDescription (If the book is CC-license, this is often a description of what the license means.)
licenseNotes  (Something that goes beyond describing the legalities of the license, often this is ued to add a condition or permit use. Example "Ask us before you translate this." or "It is ok to translate this, just send us a copy")
copyright  (e.g. "Copyright © 1993, Instituto Lingüístico de Verano, A.C.")
originalCopyright (when the book is a derivative, it may have text like "Based on the original, Copyright 1991, Generous Publishing")
smallCoverCredits  (e.g "Authored by Cassidy, Illustrated by Sundance")
topic  (e.g. Traditional Story)
credits  (e.g. "the authors, the illustrator")
versionAcknowledgments  (Normally this is all you will use, unless the version is a derivative, in which case this may say something like "this version translated by foo bar")
originalContributions
originalAcknowledgments  (This would be acknowledgements of the original that we don't want to lose, e.g. "Based on the original by Joe.")
funding  (e.g. "funded by a grant from the Foo dept of literacy")
country  (e.g. "Mexico")
province  (e.g. "Oaxaca")
district  (e.g. "Santa María Zacatepec")
author  (e.g. "Virginia López Lucas")
illustrator  (e.g. "Jose Foo")
publisher  (e.g. "Instituto de Grillo")
originalPublisher  (e.g. "Originally published by Acme Publishers")


Here is an example of what you will output

```
---
allTitles:
  bo: "ངའི་ཁང་པ་།"
  en: "My House"
languages:
  bo: "Tibetan"
  en: "English"
l1: "bo" # the primary language
l2: "en" # often a major language used for metadata, but may also be used in bilingual pages
---
<!-- page index=1 -->

<!-- text lang="bo" field="bookTitle" -->
ངའི་ཁང་པ་།

<!-- text lang="en" field="bookTitle" -->
My House

![](myHouse.jpg)

<!-- text lang="en" field="smallCoverCredits" -->
Authored by Cassidy, Illustrated by Sundance

We like it a lot.```    
    

# Rules
The final output should be a single Markdown file containing:

- Front matter using a YAML for metadata
- The original content with all text annotated for language and all the images referenced.

Ensure the document remains readable and structurally intact, and that no content is lost or misclassified. 

Never truncate anything. You must preserve it all.

If you aren't sure about the lang tag, do not hallucinate it. Just put in unk-x-languageName, e.g. if you don't know what langtag "northern foobar" uses, you can say "unk-x-northern_foobar".

If you don't even know what language it is, you can use "unk".

The following metadata fields are required: allTitles, languages, l1. Normally you can also provide l2 if there is a second language. Sometimes a book will even have an L3.

If you see a number all alone in a text area at the end of a page, it is a page number. Drop it from the output, do not output a text comment for it.

If on the page with license info, you see `# (cc)`, that's an OCR error, just drop it from the output.

Do not mislabel the licenseUrl field as "license". The licenseUrl field will look like a url. If you see a creativecommons.org license url an don't have a license, you can infer the license from the url. A proper CC license does not end in a version number, e.g. if you just see http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/, then is license "CC-BY".

Note that the cover will often have the name of the L1 on the cover. You can just drop that line, don't make a mistake like adding it to the topic.
