You are given a Markdown file that may contain multiple languages. Your task is to enrich this file by identifying metadata and languages.
    
    1. Extract all available metadata from the text, including:
        - Title(s) in all languages
        - Cover Image (the first image you encounter in the incoming MD)
        - ISBN
        - License (For Creative commons use uppercase abbreviations like "CC-BY-NC")
        - Copyright (write in this form: "Copyright © 2017, Some Special People")
        - Credits (author, illustrator, researchers)
        - Tags (e.g., topic, language)
        - Publisher and location information (country, province, district)
    2. Format this metadata as YAML front matter and insert it at the very top of the Markdown file using `---` delimiters.

    3. Annotate all blocks of text with a language comment. E.g. `<!-- lang=en --> This is my house. <!-- lang=fr --> C'est ma maison.`
    - Use ISO 639-1 or 639-3 language codes (e.g., `es` for Spanish, `mxa` for Mixteco de Santa María Zacatepec, uz-CYRL for Uzbeck in cyrillic script).
    - Preserve Markdown formatting
    - Preserve all image references
    - Use the same style to tag each metadata field. Place these comments in the body of the markdown, not in the YAML front matter. Example: `<!-- lang="fr" field="copyright" -->` or `<!-- lang="en" field="ISBN" -->`.

    4. Preserve all incoming comments. The input markdown may already have `<!-- start-page -->` comments.

    <!-- lang=en field="title" -->
    The moon and the cap

    <!-- start-page -->
    <!-- lang=en field="copyright" -->
    Copyright 1993, Instituto Lingüístico de Verano, A.C.
    <!-- lang=en field="license" -->
    CC-BY-NC

    ![](/myHouse.jpg)
    
    <!-- lang=en -->
    
    This is my house. 
    
    <!-- lang=fr -->
    
    C'est ma maison. 

    <!-- start-page -->

    <!-- lang=en -->
    
    We like it a lot.

    ![](/myFamily.jpg)
    
    <!-- lang=fr -->
    
    Nous l'aimons beaucoup.

    ```
    
    
    
    The final output should be a single Markdown file containing:
    
    - Frontmatter using a YAML for metadata
    - The original content with all text annotated for language and all the images referenced.
    
    Ensure the document remains readable and structurally intact, and that no content is lost or misclassified. 
    
    Never truncate anything. You must preserve it all.

    If you aren't sure about the lang tag, do not hallucinate it. Just put in unk-x-languageName, e.g. if you don't know what langtag "northern foobar" uses, you can say "unk-x-northern_foobar".

    The following metadata fields are required: allTitles, languages, l1. Normally you can also provide l2 if there is a second language.
