# synthetic.pdf

- from ms publisher

## good

- handled gondi, Apali (barred-is)
- put image references in the right place
- dropped page numbers as requested.

## bad

- page break on each new line

# tiger.pdf

- old with fuzzy text (no embedded text)

# gondi-immunisations.pdf

- from bloom
- the telugu script is really hard
- mistral converts the title to year numbers
- unpdf can't get the spacing right between gondi letters

# bilingual-sample

- from adobe illustrator
- has invisible English text that unpdf doens't know how to hide

# pineapple

- from MS Publisher
- most of the metadata is on the last page
- goofy layout around the CC license that would take human level intelligence to sort out
- empty "ISBN:"

# children-com

- from PBT, MS Publisher
- mistral turns all ɨ (barred i) into ł (barred l)
- gemini 2.5 pro does it too (even weirder, "agɨlasaŋ" becomes "agiɫasaŋ"). Even after asking it to improve, it still made way too many errors. (e.g. "Jisasɨ ninanadi agɨlasaŋ mavɨn hɨnimi" became "Jisasɨ ninanadɨ agɨɫasaŋ mavɨn hinimi")
- 4o did it perfectly
